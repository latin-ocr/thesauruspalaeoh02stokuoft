Liber Hymnorum. xxxv

 

27. LlnsR HYMNORUM1.

The Liber Hymnorum is contained in the following MSS.²

T.=E. 42, Trinity College, Dublin⁸. This manuscript consists of 34
’ vellum folios, about 1Οῇ- 11161165 10118 by 7 broad, with three scraps of vellum
bound at the end. After fol. 31 the writing deteriorates, and this later
portion seems to be younger than the rest of the codex. In a number of
cases the marginal 8105565 have been mutilated by the cutting of the margin.

F‘. A manuscript formerly in the library of S. Isidore’s, Rome, from
which in 1872 11 was brought to the Franciscan Convent, Merchants' Quay,
Dublin, where it now is. It consists of twenty-three leaves in small folio,
and is in a pasteboard cover, endorsed ‘ 9 vel 10 saecul.' In this codex the
Faeth Fiada and Mael isu's hymn are wanting. On 1116 lower margin of fo. 2 a
15 written in a hand of the seventeenth century ‘Ex libris conventus de
Dunnagall,' aud Sir J ames Ware, in the year 1639, quotes it as ‘Lib. uet.
hymn. conuent. Dunnagalliae.’ It appears from a remark of Ussher’s that 1116
manuscript was once in 1115 hands, and there is a paper MS. in Ussher's collec-
tion in the Library of Trinity Oollege, Dublin (E. 3. 28), containing a copy of
some of the Irish Hymns from F. In 1630 the MS. was still in Donegal, for
it was used by Michael O’Clery in his Martyrology of Donegal, written in that
year. Afterwards the MS. went to Louvain, where it was used by Golgan
for his Trias Thaumaturga‚ 1647.

T and F represent two independent recensions of the text, both of which
are indispensable for its reconstruction. Such a reconstructiou 15 full of
ἰ difficulty. For the restoration of the 1611811686 of the Hymns depends upon
