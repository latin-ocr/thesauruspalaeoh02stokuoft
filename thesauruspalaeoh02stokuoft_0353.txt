Patriclc was born. Fiaoc of Sletty composed this hymn for Patriok.

Now that Fiaec was son of Mae Ercae, son of Bregan, son of Daire
Barraig, (from whom are the Hy-Barrchi), son of Cathair Mor. Moreover
that Fiaoc was a pupil of Dubthach maccu-Lugair‚ who was chief poet of
²5 Ireland. In the time of Loegaire son of N iall it was made. And that is
the Dubthach who arose before Patrick in Tara, after Loegaire had said
that no one should rise before him in the house. And he was a friend of
Patrick thenceforward, and he was baptized by Patrick afterwards.
Now Patrick once went to that Dubthach's house in Leinster. Then
30 Dubthach gave great welcome to Patrick. Patrick said to Dubthach:
‘Seek for me‚' said he, ‘a man of rank, of good family and of good
character, with only one wife and child! ‘Why seekest thou that? (to
wit, a man of that kind)' said Dubthach. ‘That he may be ordained‚'
said Patrick. ‘Fiacc is the man‚’ said Dubthaoh, ‘and he has gone on
35 circuit in Connacht.' Now when they were thus talking, then came Fiacc
and his circuit with him. ‘There is the man whom we have been speaking
of,'said Dubthach. ‘Though it be‚' says Patrick, ‘peradventure quod diximus
will not be pleasing to him.’ ‘ Let an essay be made to tonsure me‚' said
Dubthach, ‘so that Fiacc may see.’ When Fiaec, then, saw that, he asked:
40 ‘What is essayed'e’ said he. ‘The tonsuring of Dubthach,' said they. ‘That
is idle‚’ said he, ‘for there is not in Ireland a poet his equal.' ‘Thou
