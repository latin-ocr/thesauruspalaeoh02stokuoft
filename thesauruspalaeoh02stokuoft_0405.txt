MAEL I'su’s Hm.

Mael Tsu dixit:

In spirut n6eb immun· innunn ocus ocunn:
in spirut ndeb chucunn· taet, a Christ, co hopunn!

In spirut n6eb d' aittreb· ar cuirp is ar namna,
diar snadud co solma · ar gabud ar galra.

 

Ar 'demnaib‚ ar pheccdaib · ar iffern co nilulcc
A Isu ronndeba · rons6era do spirut.
In spirut.

ιο (May) the Holy spirit be about us, in us, and with us!
Let the Holy spirit, Ο Christ, come bo us speedily.

May the Holy spirit, dwell in our body and our soul!
May He protect us readily against peril, against diseases,

Against devils, against sins, against hell with many evils,
15 Ο J esus, may Thy Spirit hallow us, deliver us!
