The Stowe Illis-sal. xxvii

15. IucANTATmNEs SANGALLENSEs1.

Codex Sangallensis nr. 1395, which is made up of a collection of frag—
ments of ancient manuscripts made by von Arx when librarian, contains
(pp. 418, 19) a single leaf of an ancient Irish manuscript of the eighth or
ninth century. The verso of the leaf contains the Irish spells written by
three hands. The first hand wrote the first three spells down to fortchiunffl.
The second hand is much coarser; from it comes the spell Tessuro—forsate,
A third hand added focertar—aleth, words which indicate the application of
some form of incantation which is not described.

16. ΤΗΕ Srown MISSAU.

The Stowe Missal is a small manuscript of 67 leaves, 53 inches long by
4} broad, now in the library of the Royal Irish Academy, Dublin. The
principal divisions of the volume are: (1) Extracts from St John's Gospel
(ff. 1—11); (2) the Missal (ff. 12—65); (3) the Irish treatise on the

Eucharist (ff. 65 b—67 a); (4) the Irish Spells (fo. 67 b). Section (1) forms
a separate quire by itself, so that there is no evidence when it was attached
to the rest of the book.
’¹ ⁴In the liturgical portion the discrimination of the original hands is far
from easy. In the first part of it, the Ordinary and Canon of the Mass
(ff. 12-38)‚ two hands seem to be found, one (Al) extending from fo. 12
to fo. 28, the other (ΑΞ) beginning at fo. 29. Both are bad and decadent
hands, and the difficulty is to know whether this is due, as often, to lateness
of date or to the inexperience of the scribes. Α2 probably continues to
fo. 46, where the Missal proper ends. The Ordo Baptismi (ff. 47—652)
begins in a hand (B) akin to Al, but probably not the same. Apparently
several hands occur in it, but it is impossible to determine exactly the
