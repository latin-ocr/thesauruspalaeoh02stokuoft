12. After this he (Fiacc) set up in Domnach Feicc, and abode there
until three 80010 111011 of his community had fallen there beside him.

13. Then the angel went unto him and said to him: “It 18 to the
west of a river 111 0111 Maige that thy resurrection is (to be) '': the spot in ²5
which they should find the boar, be it there that they put their refectory:
the stead in which they should find the doe, be it there that they put
their church. Fiacc said to the angel that he would not so go until
Patrick should have come to mark out his place and to consecrate it, and
that from him he might receive his place. After this Patrick went to 30
Fiacc and marked out his place for him, and consecrated it, and put his
meeting-groundd there. And Orimthann offered that stead to Patrick, for
it was Patrick who administered baptism to Orimthann, and in Slebte
Crimthann has been buried.

14. Sechnall went afterwards to reproach Patrick about the chariot 35
which he had. Then Patrick sent the chariot to Sechnall without a
chariotecr therein save angels that guided it. When it had remained
three nights with Sechnall he sent it on to Manchan, and with him it
remained three nights. He sent it on to Fiacc. Fiacc warned them
off⁰ afterwards. They circumambulated their church thrice, so the angel 40
said (to Fiacc): “ 'Tis to thee it hath been given by Patrick, since he
knows thy infirmity.''

15. Bishop Aed abode in Slebte. He went to Armagh. He brought
a bequest to Segene of Armagh. Segene gave again a bequest· to Aed
and Aed offered a bequest and his kindred and his church to Patrick till 45
Doom. Aed left a bequest with Conchad. Conchad went to Armagh,
3ἒά Fland Feblaef gave his church to him, and 110 took himself (as) '
a bot.
