cross is all set on the paten, and the upper part is inclined on the left
hand, as was said ε Inclinato capite tradidit spiritum.
18. The arrangement of the confraction at Easter and Christmas¹z
thirteen particles in the stem of the crosses, nine in its cross-piece,
²5 twenty particles in its circle-wheelm, five particles in each angle, sixteen
both in the circle and in the body of the crosses, that is, four for every
part. The middle particle is that to which the masspriestn goes i.e. the
figure of the breast with the secrets- What is from that upwards of the
shaft to bishops: the cross-piece on the left hand to priests: that on the

30 right hand to all subgrades ; that from the cross-piece down to anchorites
and penitents: that which is in the left upper angle to true young clerics:
the right upper to innocent children; the left lower to folk of repentance.
the right lower to folk lawfully married and to those that go not before to
commumon.

35 19. This is what God deems worthy, the mind to be in the symbols f. 66³
of the maSS, and that this be thy mind: the portion of the Host which
thou receivest (to be) as it were a member of Christ from His Cross, and
that there may be a cross of labour on each (in) his own course, because
it unites to the crucified Body. It is not meet to swallow the particle

40 without tasting it, as it is improper not to seek to bring savours into
God'e mysteries. It is not proper for it to go under the back-teeth, (this)
symbolizing that it is improper to dispute overmuch on God's mysteries,
leet heresy should be increased thereby.

Finit. Amen. Deo qratia&
