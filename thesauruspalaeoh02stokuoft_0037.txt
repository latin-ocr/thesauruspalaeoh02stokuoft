Antipho‘narium Benckorense. xxxi

 

It has been calculated that S. Fintan died in 878 A.D. His life then may
have been written towards the end of the ninth century.

22. ADAMNANI VrrA Commium&

The manuscript (= Codex A, Reeves²), from which the Irish names in
Adamnan’s Life of Columba are printed 1131οΨ, belonged formerly to
Reichenau and is now in the Stadtbibliothek of scheffhausen, where it is
numbered 32. As Reeves has shewn³, it was written by Dorbbene‚ who was
elected to the chair of S. Columba in Iona in 713 A.D. and died in the same
year, nine years after Adamnan himself. In the time between the composition
of the Life and its transcription by Dorbbene the Irish language had under-
gone certain changes, and occasionally, as a comparison with other MSS.
shews⁴, Dorbbene introduced the forms of his own time. The language is of
the same general character as that of the oldest portions of the Book of
Armagh. 5⁵ and δ’ 313 still preserved, 38. Fet-huus, N eth, Modum, Cloithe,
To'mnw. Unaccented short vowels preserve their quality, 38. Ached, Lathrey,
Nemaidoffl: ai is still universa13 Aido etc. oi appears in Broichcinus by oe in
Mese Loeffl. The variation between Golamm and Golumb (6² 1) is remarkable.
The gen. of -i- and-u· stems is in o: Aido etc.

23. ANTIPHONARIUM BENCHORENSE.

This liturgical manuscript commonly, but inaccurately, called an Anti-
phonary, was written in the monastery of Bangor (Ir. Bemzchor), on the
southern shore of Belfast Lough, during the abbacy of Gronau, i.e. between
ζ the years 680 and 691. It contains six canticles; twelve metrical hy1nns3

¹ Ed. Reeves. The Life of St Columba...written by Adamnan, ninth abbot of that monastery,
Dublin, 1857.

² The MS. is described by Reeves, op. cit. xm. sq„ who gives specimens of the script.

⁸ Op. cit. xiv.

⁴ The other MSS. are described by Beeves, op. cit. xx1v. sq. The most important linguistically
is Beeves’ Codex B, a vellum MS. of the middle of the fifteenth century, preserved in the British
unacum, Bibl. Beg. 8 D. ιι, 31111 which represents 3 text independent of A3 cf. Zimmer, KZ.
xxxu. 199. The part of this MS. containing the names oi S. Columba’s disciples and relations
is printed infra, p. 281. ·

⁸ In some cases Dorbbene has introduced a later orthography: Geannachte 56· (=Cenacte Β),
conte 58· (=Cete Β), Γιικὴηαυε 32· (ὲΓεσῘιπααε Β, O, F, S), Deathrib 52· (=Dethrib B),
Leochain 118· (=Letham' Β), Clied 55· (εσιιιεὴ Β); ea appears in final position in Lea 28·
(=Lea B), cf. dea 111 the Cambray Homily. The later ia appears in m'ath 25b (=math B);
this is doubtless due to the transcribere, not to Adamnam as to Miathorum 18· it may be
remathad that this is a foreign name, which Reeves, p. 33, identifies with the Μαιάται.

⁸ At the end of a word we find MoLua 76⁸.
⁷ The gen. Golyion 35· by Golqen is remarkable. Attention may be directed to the middle

vowel of Fechurey 23¹³ (by Fechrey 121⁸) and Ainmnrech 49⁶, Aimnurey 108·.
⁸ In 59· Boend (cf. Boemz Lib. Ard. 11⁸) comes from Bofind, but the leading Boflnd in B shews

that the form Boend is not to be imputed to Adamntn.
