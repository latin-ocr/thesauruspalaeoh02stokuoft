VII. Patrick’s H ymn&

This hymn, or rather incantation, said to have rendered S. Patrick and
his monks invisible as such, is not in metre‚ but in a sort of rhythmical
prose. It bears upon it marks of antiquity, such as the prayer to be delivered
from the spells of women, smiths² and druids or wizards. The date of its
composition cannot be determined. An inferior limit is fixed by the mention
of the work in Lib. Ardm. fo. 16ἃ 1, canticum eius (sc. Patricii) scottia-mn
semper canerc33 and the Milan glossator may possibly refer to it when he
writes cluasa Dc& (λίαν n-eitsecht (Ml. 242 18). The title, fdeth fiada, is a
mis-spelling of fo'z'ol3 (Oymr. ywaedd) fiada, and this is still further corrupted
in the seth fia of the Book of Ballymote, 345¹> 26, where wizards are said to
make feth fia (‘ magical invisibility') or prophecy (druid .i. doniat i‘n seth. fia
n6 in aisdineckt). The verbal forms of the hymn are interesting: atomriuy
from ad-dom-riuy ‘me extollo, assurg0,’ as Ascoli (Gloss. pal. hib. cxcv.)
for the first time rightly rendered this word: mi-dzzthrastar the deponential
s-conj. of malacho-accur: arachuilim where the final u has not been explained.
So in the declension: nim-t the instrumental sg. of the neuter o-stem nert:
cretim the same case of the fem. d-stem crete‘m; and foisitin the same case
of a stem in n. The hymn has been edited by Geo. Petrie (Antiquities of
Tara Hm), by W. S. (Goidelica, p. 150), by Crowe (Journal of the Kilkenny
Archaeological Association), and, lastly, by Bernard and Atkinson (the Irish
Liber Hymnorum Ι. 133-135).

VIII. Mael Isu's Hymn.

This hymn is found only in the later portion of T. The author may have
been Mael Isu, the coarb of S. Patrick‚ who, according to the Annals of
Tigernach, died in 1086, and whose day is J an. 16. The metre is rinmrd.

28. OODEX TAURINENSIS‚ F. 1v. 1⁴.

This manuscript contains six leaves of 011 Hiberno-latin liturgy. An
Old-Irish gloss is found in fo. 3³. According to W. Meyer the codex is more
probably prior than posterior to 700 A.D.⁶
