xiv Description of the MSS.

 

 

ferdonmaclzo ore'S. There were two famous scribes of this name connected
with Armagh‚ one of whom died A.D. 727, the other A.D. 845. That the
scribe of the Book of Armagh was the latter has been ingeniously proved by
Bishop Graves¹ from the following half-erased entry in a semi-Greek character,

which occurs in fo. 52 b:
..... ank hum< λ. .

Bishop Graves restored the entry thus ε

As Torbach held the primacy for only one year and died in 808, the
codex, or at least this part of it, must have been written either in 807 01· 808.

That the enti-y refers to the former year is proved by the following entry on
fo. 36³²:

εΧπλικιτ · αευαΝΓοε

,ΤΗνΜ · εκΡΙπτνΜ
(ITKNIVE (PITVM ·

= explicit euanyelion κατὰ Μ atthemn scriptum atqu-e finitum in feria Mattkei.
For Torbach died on the 16111 of J uly and this entry was made on the 26111
of September, 1116 Feast of S. Matthew. The marginal entries have in part,
been mutilated by 1116 cutting of the margins.

The Book of Armagh contains a transcript of older documents. A full
description of the contents will be fotind in the edition by W. S. of the
Tripartite Life of Patrick, XCI sq. The following portions have been published
in the present work:

I. 2Τ116 Irish names in Muirchu Maccu Machtheni's memoirs of S.
Patrick (fol. 2³ 1--fo. 9² 2). This Muirchu professes 10 write in obedience
10 1116 command of Bishop Aed of Sletty, †698. The importance of these
notes for the language of the time has been pointed 01113 by Thurneysen⁸.
The following points may be noted:

Long ἑ has not yet become ia: F500=an003 Cerriyi=oia2vraiya Of ὁ there is an
example in the Latinised Coolemzorum. Unaccented ἔ and ὅ between nonsspalatal
consonants are preserved: Olocker=clockar‚ Findubrec, Lucetmail, Ulod, Lotltrocffl. Oi

⁴¹ There is a variation between a and o in Dubthach and Dubthoch3 cf. Echach by ΕσΙιοοΙι,
Α1111. Ul. 817. In Latinised form Ulathorum appears by Ulotlwmm3 according 10 Thumeysen,
this is perhaps due 10 the scribe. Unaccented α appears 66 0 in moccu Echach.
