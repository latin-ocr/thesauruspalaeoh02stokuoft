¹ Ed. W. 8., KZ. xxxr. 246 sq. Cf. Rev. H. M. Bannister‚ Journal of Theological Studies‚

1903, pp. 49 sq. The first fragment is written on the margin and has been mutilated by the
cutting of the leaf. How much has been cut away may be conjectured from a mutilat-ed piece
of Latin on the margin of the other side of the leaf, which, as the Rev. Η. Μ. Bannister saw,
agrees closely in its first part with the Stowe Missal, fo. 24 a:
