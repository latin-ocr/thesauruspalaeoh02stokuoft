7 aben ......‚ ‘once an angel came to Erigit, and sent her to release her

mother who was with the wizard, named Mac Midrui. Her mother was of
²5 Connaught and her father of the men of Munster, and she was at that time
in Mag Fenamna in ...... Cliach. Now when Brigit got as far as that,
her mother was with an eye-disorder at the milking-yard. Brigit went with
the wizard's charioteer to her mother, and took the cooking in her stead,
and she used to perform great charity with the wealth3 and the wizard
30 heard that. The charioteer went home. ‘How is it at the milking-
plaoess’ said the wizard. ‘ I am contented in the first place,' said the
charioteer, ‘and the calves are fat, and the guests are contented.’ And
the wizand and his wife were displeased that charity was wrought by
Brigit. So they came, with a large hamper, to get a chan-:ee at Brigit
35 and to enslave her afterwards unless plenty of butter were found with
her. And yet she had only the produce of a ehurning and a half„ So
she repeated this stave : ‘My store-room, a store-room of fair God, a store-
room which my King has blessed, a store-room with somewhat therein.'
And she said again: ‘May Mary's son, my Frieud, oome to bless my
40 stote-mom ! The Prinoe of the world to the border, may there be plenty
with Him !' And she said a third time : ‘O my Prince, who hast power
over all these things! BleSS, Ο God—a. cry unforbidden--with Thy right
hand this store-room !' She parted the churnings (into three) sub etc. A
half—chuming she then brought out of the store-room. ‘That is good to
45 fill a big hamperl' said the wizard's wife. ‘Fill ye your hamper‚' said
Brigit, ‘and God will put somewhat therein’ ...¹ F¹¹¹⁸ 2. fe'n douc
