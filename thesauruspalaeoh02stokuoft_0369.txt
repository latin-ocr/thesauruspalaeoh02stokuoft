Bri9it ὁὲ hithmaich. It may have been Columcille who made this

hymn. And he made it in the time of Aed son of Ainmire, if it is ,

116 who made it. This is the cause of its composition. A great storm

> cameto Columcille, when he went over sea, and he came to Oorryvreckan‚
, ²5 and 116 1163003111 Brigit that a calm might come to him, and said Briqit
> be hithmaich. Or it 13 Broccan the squinting that made it, and it was
made at the same time as Ni car Briyit. Or it 13 three of Brigit's
household that made it. They went to Rome, and reached Placentia,
and 0116 of 1116 people of the city met with them without, and asked

30 them whether they needed hospitality. They said they did. He took

was given to them in ale, and they praised Brigit for their dehverauce, and
sang Briyit ὂὲ hithmaith. They drank up the ale with the poison and it

did them no hurt. So the master of the house came to see whether the
poison had killed them. And he ‘saw them alive, and he saw a fair

40 maiden among them. Then he came into the house, and was seeking the
maiden, and he found her not, He asked them where the maiden had
gone, and they said they had not seen her. Then they were put in bonds
