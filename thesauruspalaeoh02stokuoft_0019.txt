Liber Ardmachanus. xiii

 

(b) Codex Par-idaeus, MS. Lat. 10‚400¹.

A manuscript in the Bibliotheque Nationale‚ consisting of fragments of
MSS. found for the most part in bindings etc. The fragment ff. 109, 110 is
in an Irish hand probably of the ninth century3 it is a bookbinding and is
very hard to decipher. In one instance at least beccim, the Irish gloss, is
attached to the wrong Latin word.

(c) Codex Pam'siacus, MS. Lat. 11411 ².

This is another fragment, also a bookbinding, in the same library, probably
of the ninth century. According to Dr F riedel the glosses are in a different
ink and thinner. He thinks that the leaf belonged to the same body as
10‚400. Some of the Irish glosses are attached to the wrong words.

Iu fo. 2222—2261‘ of this codex, which has been assigned to the ninth
century‘, is an alphabetical Latin glossary, in three columns, with glosses
added in various hands. Among these glosses there are a few Irish ones,
written in the same hand as the text.

7. 00an IUUENCI.

This codex is in the University Library of Cambridge, where it is
numbered Ff. 4. 42. It is thus described by Hardwick and Luard: “A quarto,
on parchment, 108 leaves, about 28 lines in each page; handwriting as early

ἶ as the ninth century. The date 1233 is twice written in the margin, but
if meant to indicate the time at which the MS. was executed, it is far too

modern. ‘Quatuor Euangelia a quenco Presbytero pene ad verbum translata‚'
so reads the colophon....'' The text contains a large number of British, and

a few Irish, glosses⁵.
