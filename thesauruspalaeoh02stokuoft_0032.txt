xxvi Description of the MSS.

The Celtic glosses are written in the text, but are generally indicated by
perpendicular or horizontal strokes. For the most part the Celtic words
stand out of construction in the sentence3 sometimes they are obviously
misplaced. They seem to have been originally notes and glosses on the
text, which later oopyists incorporated thereinl.

14. CODEX CANONUM HIBERNIOORUM CAMARACENsls².'

This is a manuscript of the eighth century³, preserved in the public
Library of Cambray, nr. 619. It consists of 72 leaves, and contains the
text of the Irish Canons down to Lib. XXXVIII. 18 med. It has been copied
by a continental hand from a manuscript in the Irish character4. In the
archetype there had been inserted by chance a leaf containing a fragment
of an Irish homily. This was copied by the continental scribe along with
the rest of the codex3 the words are often wrongly divided, and there·
are many clerical errors resulting from the scribe's unfamiliarity with the ¹
Irish script.

The Irish is very archaic, and dates from the second half of the seventh
or the beginning of the eighth century⁵. The following points may be
noted. Internal e has not yet become ῑα, eg. feda=later fiada3 at the
end of a word, however, it appears as ea, dea=later dia. Similarly ὃ has
not yet become ᾶα, eg. ood=later aad. Unaccented ἕ is preserved in
autrubert, le, mandem, and in the possessive pronoun‚ ἰἠθ6 chuis‚ i‘ne zaim,
ine merorib, inae lobri, inae seth, inae dommetu, faire chomnessam3 but a
appears where no preposition precedes: α bees, a deserce, a fuil, and after
fri : fria thola, fria tola3 similarly are n-indarbe, are n-airema, aire sechethar,
aure ociosa, but ara tinola. Unaccented ὅ is preserved in sedet, tutheyot,
tuesmot. Pretonic to· is preserved before verbal forms: tu-theyot‚ tuesmot, ζ
tondecomnaeuir, but before nouns we find du, do. In the article pretonic
nd is preserved in dumlaib, but has become ‘rm in iuna. A long vowel
is often expressed by doubling, eg. iseo, bees, dmm. Amail, intain appear, ,
not amal, intem.
