35 Τ116 fierce lad, who had besought Brigit for her King's sake,

monster besought Brendan and the other saints of Ireland against the 5
other beast, and that protected it not till it besought Brigit. After that
Brendan said that he would be no longer at sea till he knew why this
miracle had been wrought for Brigit and not for others. Then Brendan
set out to go to Brigit, and that was revealed to Erigit. At that time
Brigit was herding sheep in the Curragh of the Liffey. She went to ιο
meet Brendan to Domnach Mor to the west of Kildare, and they greeted
each of them the other. At Brendan’s stone on the day after in the
heat Brigit cast her wet cloak 011 the sunbeams, and it remained upon
them. Brendan told his servant to put his cloak upon them, and it
fell from them twice. The third time Brendan himself cast it with 15
anger, and then it remained upon them. Brigit asked her cook how
much food she had. She said that she had only one eighth of barley
grain. Then it was taken to the mill of Rath Cathair west of Kildare
twice, and they would not grind it there, for Elill son of Dunlaing, king
of Leinster, chanced to be there at that time at Rath Cathair. Brigit's 20
servant went a third time, and he was cast into the mill-race along with
his sack. Afterwards Brigit cursede Rath Cathair that there should be
neither smoke nor fires nor men in it for ever. And the whole mill sank
beneath the earth. So Brigit‘s servant took his sack from the mill-rane
. . . . and its other half of meal of malt. Therewith a feast was made for 25
Brendan and for Brigit and for her household, and they were thirty days
consuming that feast together. And each of them confessed to the other.
Brendan said first that ever since he became pious he had never gone over
seven furrows without his mind on God. ‘It is well,² said Brigit, ‘I
thank God! Brigit said however (that since she had fixed) her mind on 30
God, she had never taken it from Him at all. Brendan marvelled thet-eat.
