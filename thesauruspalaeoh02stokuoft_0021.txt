In‘ber Ardmachanus. xv

does not yet appear as oe: Loiyuim, but by ai is found ae: Lucetmail and Lucetmael.
Astur a non-palatal consonant final -ί is expressed by -i, not by -ai ε Calpdi, Fer-cherma,
sorti, Maahi. But in the same position we find ·e: Mache, Slane, -aez Arddoe, ΕσνασΙιιω,
Haemo, and ωε Grecoao, Machae. The gen. sg. is -ο, not -az Deqo.

ΠΙ. The Irish names in the miscellaneous notes on the life of S. Patrick,
which Bishop Tirechan is said to have written ea: ore uel libro of his foster-

father or tutor (aite) Bishop Ultan, † 656 (fo. 9⁸ 2—f0. 16² 1). The language
shews the same characteristics as Ι, only not so strictly:

ὃς ΟέπαοΙιιω, Cinnani, Caranus, Οόνηζᾳί, emach, Feccus, Feckaok, ΓὲοΙινασΙι, Neel. It
has become ea in Druimleas (cf. feadinne in the glosses on Philargyrius)‚ and at the end
of a word, Bandea (cf. deazdia in the Gambray Homily). It has become ῖα 111 swan.

6: Bain, Booin, Boonriqi, Beidmaic, Coonu, Οἰῡηο, ΟνῦσΙιᾶη, θὸεασΙιι, Gema-lctus, Irloclzir.
But also τῖαε Βᾶαίπ, Buta-3, Okmdzlain, Eslzaaid, Maaide, Latinised Mundam, tltz'caz'tlae.
It will be observed that, except m Bam, foa appears only before a palatal consonant.

ὅ preserved: Aclaed, Aryetbor, Eckredd. By Oonylenq and Ercleny, howex er appear
Oculum-q and Erclanq in the list of names on fo. 9¹² 2.

ὄ preserved: Adrochtae, Gemmas, H zrotae Mau tortlzzye Niothq Telock. The later Focldad
appears both as Focklotk and Foclzlutlt. Corresponding to the Ogham name Goszaecias‘l we
find θόεαοΙιε, where Gesocht might have been expected.

After a non· -palatal consonant i: Aryi, Gemi, Confi, Chunyi, Elui, Endi‚Fe1-ci, dewtc
Ducleti3 also 111 the interior of a word: Amolnqid, Gaplz't, cam-ic, Gerriyi, Irlbclzim Tazdiclz,
ser-cib. But Ohunqai and Imi, Humail.

» After a 11011- -palatal consonant final -e is commonly written -:oe ΑοῑνοοΙιιιε, Bri-qm,
OEnacktoe, G'omyelloe, C'orroe, Ercae, Herotae, Machoe, Sinnoe, Succae. But also Core, Erce (MS.
⁹ Ger-oe), and once Asachae. AE appears sometimes after a palatal consonant: Colunzbcz'llae,
Dumium, Slt'cthhoe3

oi regularly. Coimanum, Loiquire, loiqles, quus4.
ai happens to occur only before a palatal consonant: Mami, Boidmicf».

From -i- and -u· stems the gen. sg. is regularly in -οε Audeo, Alo, Arddsratlco, Clo'no,
Drommo, Ferqusso, Icho, Nemo, Temro. Once a: Airddsratlza.

III. Additions to the notes of Tirechan 111 Latin and Irish (fo. 16*ι 2-
fo. 18¹³ 2)⁸. The language of these additions shews later characteristies than
the notes ¹of Tirechan. It seems on the whole to represent the Irish of the
early eighth century, though some later forms may have been introduced by
the copyist, eg. ni fetorsa = πί fetarsa:

ἕ prem-ved: adootedae, atrapert, ochter, toidached. But adopart, contubart.
ὅ preserved: cambach, σοηαοοζιο, edocht, fithot, omem-rocla. But aidackt, catkbaclzf.

¹ v. infra 262-269, and see G. Z. 1. 348, 111. 276. 2 Brash, p. 190, 198.

⁸ Of. Celt. Zeitschr. ιν. 477; the orthography is probably due to the confusion of ae and e in
Latin.

⁴ From Froech the gen. is Fruich, ef. γαίῃ Philargyrius, tuib Stowe Missal.

⁸ By Sele there is also found Saele3 so Campum Caeri corresponds to May Ceroe, Trip.
Life, 110.

⁸ 'Ibe Irish in the Latin notes is printed infra pp. 269—271, the Irish notes infra pp. 238—243.

⁷ The preposition oc is written uec or uc: uec Raith Bilich, τωο ΒοηιηασΙι, uc Sci Patrio. So
in the Annals of Ulster uc Guiuciu 710, uc Biliu 713, uc Etarlinddu 735.
