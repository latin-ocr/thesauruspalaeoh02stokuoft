viii Prefaoe.

 

 

 

Seventhly, by Count Nigra, for his correction of our reading of the third
gloss in the Vienna Eutychius‚ infra, p. 42.

Eighthly‚ by Dr Friedel, for information as to the codex of Eutychius in
the Paris MS. lat. 10‚400, and by Dr P. Giles for notes regarding the Irish
MSS. at Cambridge.

Ninthly, by the reverend librarian of the Franciscan monastery, Dublin,
for giving us aoeess to the copy of the Liber Hymnorum in his charge, and
to the authorities of the British Museum, the Royal Irish Academy, and the
libraries at St Gall, Milan, the Vatican and Vienna for permitting MSS. to
be photographed on our behalf.

We have, lastiy, to express our surprise and regret that the statement
in the prefaoe to our first volume, as to the laok of scientifie aecuracy in
some editions of Old-Irish glosses, should have been taken to apply to the
publioations of Professor Ascoli and Count Nigra. For the work of those
distinguished scholars we have now, as we have had always, high admiration
and sincere gratitude.
