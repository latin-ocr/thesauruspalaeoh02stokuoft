DESCRIPTION OF THE MSS. CONTAINING THE GLOSSES
ETC. PRINTED IN THIS VOLUME.

1. Connx AUGUSTINI CAROLSRUHAN1¹.

THIS manuscript formerly belonged to the monastery of Reichenau²,
and 16 now in the Hof- und Landesbibliothek at Caflsruhe, where it is
numbered Codex Augiensis cxcv, It consists of 47 leaves, of which 7, 8,
19, 20, 21, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 41, 42 are palimpsest. Most of the pages
contain two columns3 ff. 26, 28, 30, 31, 33, 37, 45, 46, 47 contain only one.
F 0. 1 and fo. 47, which were once attached to the inner sides of the wooden
cover, but have now been separated from it and are included in the pagina-
tion, do not belong to the codex. Fo. 1 is very faded3 in col. 1 twenty-four
fresh lines have been written, according to Windisch, probably in the same
hand as the bulk of the codex, The greater part of the codex (fo. 2—fo. 39
001. 1) 16 occupied by the Soliloquies of St Augustine3 in these folios and in
the twenty-four lines added 011 fo. 1 the Irish notes and glosses are found.

Windisch considers that the Irish glosses are probably in the same hand
as the Latin text, some of them having been written at the same time
as the Latin, others having been added afterwards, but that some of the
corrections may be in another hand.

According to Mone, Holder, and Windisch the codex belongs to the ninth ·
century. This date is supported by certain linguistic peculiarities in the MS..
particularly by some changes which have taken place in final vowels:
rei =re'e 2d 1, etaryna= etaryne 6ᾖ 2, taudbartha 7¹² 2, reta corptha 8b 1, besyna
13¹1 1, insarta 27¹³ 1. But the glosses may in whole or in part be older. Such
errore as sochtmacht 5‘l 4, adromarsu 7³ 1, asmobartmart 12ο 1, aim 14¹² 2, caisin
28r 1, point to transcription³.

¹ Edd. Windisch, Irische Texte 11. 146—163, W. S„ The Old-Irish glosses at Wiirzburg and
0611616116, 143-163. For a full description of the codex 666 Windisch, op. cit. 143—146. A
specimen of the writing will be found in Silvestre-Medda, Palaeography p. 609.

² At the bottom of the first page of the codex proper is written “ Liber Augie Maioris.''

³ A still more decisivo proof of this is to be found in 121¹, if the conjecture be right that after
innam some words like adciat ’ἰηιῖὴῐ have been omitted per imriam.
