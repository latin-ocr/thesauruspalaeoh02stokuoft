there anything in the subject-matter to suggest interpolation. The stori
are of the same kind as those related in the Patrician documents in t
Book of Armagh3 a little variation is found vv, 45 sq., and an exaggeration
of the older story in v. 56. But on the whole the narratives agree closely.
The exception is v. 34. The documents in the Book of Armagh (fo. 13¹· 2}
record only one occasion on which Patrick raised the dead to life, and then
it was a giant whom he raised from the grave to shew his unbelieving
followers that there had been actually a man of such a stature as his tombs.

III. N inine’s Prayer.

This prayer is traditionally ascribed to the poet Niniue (notes to F 61.
Oeng. J uly 6, Dec. 11) or to Fiacc, bishop of Sletty. It is a highly alliterative ·
piece, without rhyme, and with no well-defined metrical system. As to the
number of syllables, the first two lines are based on the division 745.
Windisch, omitting primapstal in line 6, would divide the poem thusz⁹
745. 7÷5; 10. 5. 9; 10. 5. 9; 10. 10. The absence of rhyme deprives us ’
of the most important criterion for fixing the date of the poem3 the language
shews no signs of lateness, except what may be fairly imputed to the tran- -
scribers.

IV. U ltan's Hymn.

This hymn, traditionally ascribed to Columcille ‘or to Ultan of Ard .
Breccain († 656), to three of Brigit's community‚ or to Bnssnainn, is the
only one of the Irish hymns which shews high poetic art. There is
nothing in the language to shew that the poem cannot go back to the
seventh century A.D. The text has been restored below on the assumption
that the poem is of so early a date.

V. Broccdn's H ymn3.

In the hymns previously considered nothing has been discovered that
would point to a later date than the early part of the ninth century. In the
present hymn, taken as a whole, there are to be observed changes in the
