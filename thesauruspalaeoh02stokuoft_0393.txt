time ...... For Brigit had given his eowl to a certain leper, to wit, when
she was guarding the workshop and he was striking the bell after Brigit had
ordered him to do so, as the bellringer was not at hand. Conlaed asked
a gal-ment of Brigit. ....... and, howbeit, she had no garment to give
ἰο 111111. She asked of Ronohenn, a subdeacon who always took care of her
dreSS, if she had not a garment. ‘There will be‚’ said he, ‘if you only
pray to God! Thereafter a garment was found 1n the basket of Ronchenn
in a chariot of two wheels, which were under the ohariot. Or Ronchenn
is not the name of a man at all, but it is a garment like to the skin of a

given to Conlaed. Conlaed, however, then set out to go to Rome. Brigit

said to him: ‘ You will not get there and you will not come back? So it

was fulfilled, for wolves devoured him at. ..¹' ΕΜ 4. .i. etach, ‘a garment'
