Codex Sancti Pauli. xxxiii

Bible. The contente are of a miscellaneous character3 on ff. lb and 4b stand
the Irish poenis printed below, all written in the same hand. The codex
has been assigned to the eighth century by Windisch, to the ninth by
Zimmer¹. The latter date is in accordance with the indications of the
language'. But some at least of the poems are of a considerably earlier
origin.

The contents of the poems are as follows:

1. Some sort of charm or incantation, in part unintelligible.

11. A poem treating of the doings of the bookish writer and his
favourite cat Panyur batn, edited by Windisch‚ Ir. Texte‚ Ι. 316; and with a
French translation, in Rev. Celt. v, 128. The following peculiarities of the
language may be noted, some of which would seem to point to the ninth
. century. Such are:

(a) Final -a=-ae: memma.

(b) bula monosyllabic=biid (the regular form in the Old-Irish glosses).

(c) πάν by michar.

(d) -sem=-som. This is frequent in Sg.³, and is established for about 800 A-D. by

the rhyme in Fel. Oeng., Ep. 524. The poem has also -3am for -som; once it is established
by the rhyme with qal. Such a rhyme does not yet appear in Fel. Oeng.

(e) The aspiration of the object: cha-31:⁴¹.

(s) Neut. nach. for na: nack re‘5.

(9) dufuit=older detuit.

In the case of such peculiarities as are not established by the metre, it is
uncertain whether they are to be imputed to the writer or to the scribe.
For sein, fe'ssin etc. the poem has ce'in, and cesin by fesin. Such forms
, likewise appear in the St Gall glosses‚ in the Cambray Homily‚ and in the
Imram Brain. Whether they are archaic or dialectical is not clear.

ΙΙΙ. A riddling poem ascribed to Suibne Geilt, a king who is said to have
lost his reason in the battle of Moira. The form duriyni is found in Ml.
and Sg. but not in Wb., which, however, has sg. i. doriynius. The word for
‘ star ' is still rdtylu not rdtla, as it became later.

IV. Verses extracted from a poem ascribed to St Moling †697. The
poem in its present form is of a much later date, but there is nothing in the
rhymes to prevent its ascription to an early period. If J. S. be right in his
conjecture that nem is for ne'm = niam, the poem cannot be later than about
7003 if so, the verses may actually have been written by that saint. The
whole poem is found in five MSS„ viz. the Book of Leinster p. 284¹), the Book
of Ballymote‚ p. 256⁸, the Book of Lismore, f. 45⁸, and the Bodleian codices

¹ simpl—cutum, 15.

r ¹²:330oe in particular the confusion of nn and nd, and the treatment of final vowels in the
ο poem.

² cf. Gelt. Zeitschr. 1v. 490. In Ml. and Wb. -sem is rare, Celt. Zeitschr. 1v. 66.
