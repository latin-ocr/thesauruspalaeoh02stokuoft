10. CODICES PRISCIANI.

The following manuscripts of Priscian contain Irish glosses and notes:
A. Codex sangallensis No. 904.

B. Codex Augiensis No. CXXXII, nunc Carolsruhanus.
C. Codex Leidensis. Cod. Lat„ 67.
D. Fragmentum Ambrosianum. Cod. A. 138 sup.

It has been shewn by Hertz² that the first three codices come from a
common source, and that A and C are especially closely related. From a
photograph of a page of D it is clear that it belongs to the same family³‚
and that it is even more closely related to C⁴ than A is, while at the same time
it can neither have been the source of C nor can it have been copied from C.

Irish glosses are by far most numerous in A. In part B has similar
Irish glosses to A, but it has also many Irish glosses peculiar to itself.
Most of the Irish glosses in C are also found in A. Corresponding to the
Irish glosses in D are generally found Irish glosses in A, but while they
agree in sense, they often differ in form⁵. It is to be observed further that
no two of the other collections have an Irish gloss in common which is not
shared by A; the only instance, however, is scilenn (Sg. 93a 1) :failen
(Per. sva 1) = foicenn (Pld. 59a). '

In addition to the Irish glosses the MSS. have a larger or smaller number

1 Through inadvertence the few Irish glosses in this text have been published under the name
of Philargyrius, and so they are given from P on p. 48 of the present volume. The readings of
Ρ2 and G will be found infra p. 418. The full Latin text has now been published by Hagen.
