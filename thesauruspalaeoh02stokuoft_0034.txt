xxviii Description of the MSS.

points of change, or how far the differences are due to progressive deteri-
oration on the part of a single scribe. The latter part of the treatise,
however, appears to be certainly by a different hand from the beginning
of it. There is also to be distinguished the hand of a corrector, Moelcaich²,
whose signature appears on fo. 37, where his activity ends. As to the rubrics,
up to fo. 23 inclusive only the words lethdirech sund on fo. 18 appear to
be in the hand of Moelcaich. From fo. 24 Canon dominicus papae Gilam'
onwards they appear to be all in his hand, except the Irish notes inserted
in a small hand on fo. 34. After Moelcaich disappears there 616 at least
two hands apparent in the titleS, one on ff. 38 and 47, the other on ff. 42
and 44¹³. The title and prayer on fo. 46³², before the Ordo Baptismi, are in
a hand resembling that of Moelcaich, and may be his. The Irish treatise 011
the Eucharist and the Spells are written in different rough hands.

With regard to the date of the script, Dr Kenyon would assign that of
Moelcaich to the tenth century. If that be so, he would assign the original
hands (Α), A2, B) to the beginning of the tenth century or possibly the end
of the ninth‚ but not earlier. The Irish treatise and spells are written in
rough hands which are difficult to date. According to Dr Kenyon they can
hardly be earlier than the eleventh century, and they might well be later².

If the codex is to be put so late, there is evidence from the language
that the texts have been transcribed from a much older original, Note—

cases is not clear. The preposition di before a noun has not yet become do:

hand there are instances of later phenomena, which may be put down to
the chances of transcription3 such as dana=ddnac, Mass ᾖ 16, by aumas,

⁹ Dr Kenyon gives these results with diffidence‚ and thinks there is far more hope of arriving
at an approximate date on liturgical or linguistic grounds than on palaeographical consideratione
alone. “
