Description of the MSS.

 

2. CODICES BEDAE.

Irish notes and glosses have been discovered in two manuscripts of Bede:

(a) Codex Carolsruhanus (Augiensis) CLXVII.
(b) Codex Bedae Vindobonensis n. 15298 (or Suppl. 2698).

These two codices shew the same recension of the Latin text. In part
the Irish glosses are identical in both. These common glosses must have

come from a common source; they have not been copied from one codex into
the other.

(a) Oodeoe Auyiensis CLXVIP, nunc Garolsruhanus.

This manuscript once belonged to the monastery of Reichenau, and 18
now in the Hof- und Landesbibliothek at Carlsruhe. It now consiste of
49 leaves, of which, however, 5—12 belong to a distinct codex of Beda. The
manuscript contains a selection of his works. It is interspersed with notes and
glosses in various hands, from one of which come the Irish notes and glosses.

Various chronological notes are added on the margins, most of which are
printed below, p. 283. Others are:

From a series of marginal entries in another hand, 1119 last of which 18
DCCOXLVIII V1·M XLVIII ab initio mundi³, Zimmer concludes that the Latin
text was written before 1119 year 848. The date of 1119 addition of the Irish¹
glosses he seeks to determine from 1119 marginal note 011 fo. l7b, in 1119 hand
of 1119 scribe who wrote the Irish glosses. The Muirchath mentioned there
. is identified by him, with great probability, with the Muirchath whose
deposition is mentioned in the Annals of the F our Masters ΑΛ). 821. If
immediately after his deposition he retired to Clonmacnois, his death, if the
identification be correct, would have taken place about ΑΛ). 831, 1.9. 111 the
tenth year of his retirement. Zimmer⁴ supposes that the scribe was on
terms of friendship with Muirchath before he left Ireland‚ and regards it as
probable that the glosses were written about 850 A.D.
