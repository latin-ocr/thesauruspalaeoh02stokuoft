Liber Hymnorum. xxxvii

on Priscian. The language of the hymn strongly resembles that of the
Felire Oengusso, which belongs to about 800 A.D. The most striking de-
parture from Old-Irish usage is the use of anacht (1. 22) for the relative
anachte. As the repetition of the initial words after l. 45 shews‚ the hymn
falls into two parts. The conclusion, certainly a later addition, contains an
invocation of Irish saints, one of whom, Adamnan‚ died in 704. According
to the glossator of F, Dermait ua Tigernan, bishop of Armagh in 848, added
ll. 47—54, and Mugron, abbot of Iona from 964 to 980, added ll. 51, 52.

As to the substance of the poem, M. Henri Gaidoz (Revue celtique V. 94—
103) points out that it falls into three divisions: 1. the original work
(ll. 1—37), 2. a first addition (11. 38—48), and 3. a second addition (ll. 49-
56); and shews that the prototype of the first (ll. 1—37) is in the Roman
breviary, where it is entitled: Commendatio animae quando infirmus estin
extremis.

I I . Fiacc’s H ymw.

This hymn is traditionally ascribed to Fiacc bishop of Sletty, whose
consecration by S. Patrick is recorded in the Book of Armagh (infra p. 241).
But it must have been composed after the desolation of Tara (A.D. 561), which
is mentioned in VV. 20 and 44. For the real date of its composition the
language of the poem furnishes the surest criterion. A superior limit is
, given by the fact that mm and mb have fallen together (immi ε timmi ll. 31,
32); as to nd and ‘nn there is unfortunately no evidence, but the change of
mh to mm and nd to nn belong to the same period of the language. Roughly
these changes may be assigned to the close of the eighth century3 for the
Felire Oengusso they are established by the rhyme. An inferior limit is
given by the treatment of final vowels: -a‚ -ae and -ai are still kept apart2,
also -e and ·i³. This points to a date at the latest not much later than 800.
The Middle-Irisbisms which have crept in in the course of transmission can
be removed without detriment to the metre‘.

Zimmer and Atkinson find extensive interpolation in the hymn. But, as
so sharpsighted an observer as Thurneysen has remarked, the language of the
verses supposed to be interpolated differs in no way from that of the verses
admitted to be genuine. Nor, with one exception to be spoken of below, is

Rev, Oelt. VI. 326 sq. ; Bernard and Atkinson 11. η. sq„ 175 sq.

² Confusion of ae and a must be assumed if bebae l. 6 is to rhyme with feba 1. 7, but the rhyme
here is not obligatory. In l. 45 adcolrra seems to rhyme with lobrai, but adcobrai may be
restored, chhadranmzi, 1³61. Oeng. Sep. 6.

⁸ Zimmer, Keltische Kirche 217 (=p. 40 of Miss Meyer’s translation), assigns the poem to the
tenth century. But the language is decisivo against this.

⁴ Thus doefuc l. 36 may be replaced by donizo, doqfiuseced l. 34 by donniusced (if the verse be not
an interpolation), imaue v. 66 by immalle. For dodjeta's in place of dasetis, which the metre
would equally allow, analogica may be found in later Old-Irish, cf. Celt. Zeitschr. 1v. 67.
