xxxvi Description of the MSS.

 

 

their date, and the chief, in some cases the only, evidence for the date of
composition is furnished by the language. In our reconstruction we have
been guided by the evidence of date supplied by the language, and
particularly by the evidence of the rhymes, which often give valuable
indications how far certain sounds had fallen together at the time of the
composition of the poems. We are well aware of the uncertainty of the
process and that in this matter opinions will be sure to differ. But even
an imperfect reconstruction seemed preferable to a mere recording of the
readings of the manuscripts.

Both T and F contain Irish prefaces which, except in Colman's Hymn,
are practically identical‚ and a number of glosses and scholia. In part these
are common to both manuscripts, 50 that they must have been copied from a
common source3 in part they are peculiar to one manuscript or the other.
In particular the margins of F are filled with long Irish notes, which are
unfortunately in part very hard to decipher and in part altogether illegible.
For the sake of completeness these notes have been printed below, though
they are of little real value for the interpretation of the text. The notes on
the language are for the most part either superfluous or erroneous, and the
various stories narrated to illustrate the text, particularly in Broccan's Hymn,
may represent forms of the legends long subsequent to the composition of the
poems.

With regard to the date of the manuscripts, that of T has been disputed.
We have seen that Τ 61111 F contain common scholia, which must have been
derived from a common older source. Now the language of these common
scholia shews that they cannot be earlier, in part at least, than the eleventh
century. Hence T cannot be dated earlierthan the end of the eleventh
century 01 the beginning of the twelfth. As to F, for the same reasons it
can hardly be put 6611161 than the end of the eleventh century or the
beginning of the twelfth, and it may be somewhat later than T.

I. Oolmdn's Hymw.

This hymn is traditionally assigned to Colman, lector of Cork, and it is
said to have been composed by way of defence against the plague which
devastated Ireland in the middle of the seventh century². The indicatione
in the hymn itself point to the early part of the ninth century. A superior
limit may be found in the mention of Joseph, the husband of Mary, who
seems not to be commemorated in Irish liturgies before about 800 ΑΔ). An
inferior limit may be found in the treatment of final vowels. As the rhyme
shews, there is yet 6.8. 110 confusion between final -ae and final ·a, a confusion
well established for the middle of the ninth century by the St Gall glosses
