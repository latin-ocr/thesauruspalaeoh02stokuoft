Now this was the cause of its composition. A great pestilence was sent
on the men of Ireland, namely the Buide Connaill, which ransacked all
Ireland, and left only one man in eitery three alive in Ireland. And it

ἰο was to protect them and his school against that pestilence that Colman
made this hymn. And it befell that he composed it when he began to
make for a certain island of the sea of Ireland, outside, fieeing from this
pestilence, so that there might be nine waves between them and the land,
for pestilence does not pass beyond that, ut fhru‘nt periti. And one of

25 the school asked Colman what was the blessing wherein it had befallen
them to take the road. So then has said Colman: “What blessing is it‚''
said he “but God’s blessing‘l'² For this is what they essayed, to go forth
on islands of the sea, fleeing before the disease.
