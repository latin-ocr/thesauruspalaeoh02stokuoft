PREFACE To VOL. ΙΙ.

Ε have little to add to the preface to the first volume of the present

work, save an expression of thankfulness for the sympathetic reception
which it has met with from the few scholars capable of discerning its un-
doubted defects. The delay in publishing the second volume was caused by
the desirability of recollating with the MSS. some of the glosses at St Gall,
Carls'ruhe aud Leyden, and the obscure notes in the F ranciscan Liber
Hymnorum. This, we hope and believe, has been done effectually.

We have now to acknowledge the help afforded by the following scholars
and public bodies during the passage of this volume through the press:

First, by Professors Windisch and Thurneysen‚ each of whom read a proof
of pp. 1—359, and made (as in the case of our first volume) many valuable
corrections and suggestions, To Professor Thurneysen, moreover, we are

. indebted for a laborious collation of a large number of the glosses on the

St Gall Priscian, which MS. was, for that purpose, deposited during a
whole year in the library of the University of Freiburg in Breisgau by the
authorities of the Stiftsbibliothek‚ St Gall.

Secondly‚ by Hof· und Landesbibliothekar Dr Alfred Holder, who collated
for us the glosses and notes in the Carlsruhe Augustino, Beda and Priscian.

Thirdly, by Mr Edward Gwynn‚ Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin‚ who
sent us his readings of many obscure passages in the Book of Armagh and the
Stowe Missal, and by the Gouncil of the Royal Irish Academy, who deposited
that Missal in the British Museum, where it was examined for us by that
eminent palaeographer Dr Kenyon.

F ourthly‚ by the late Monsieur L. Duvau, who transcribed for us, shortly
before his much-lamented death, the glosses in the copy of Philargyrius
contained in the Bibliotheque N ationale, MS. latin, 11‚308.

Fisthly, by Professor Kern, for a collation of the Priscian glosses at Leyden,
and by Dr De Vries, the librarian of the Leyden University, who deposited
the original MS. for our use in the Rylands library, Manchester.

Sixthly, by Professor Ascoli, who corrected two mistakes in our first
volume, p. 110, l. 41, and p. 615, l. 17, and supplied information as to the
-Milan fragment of Priscian infra, p. 232.
