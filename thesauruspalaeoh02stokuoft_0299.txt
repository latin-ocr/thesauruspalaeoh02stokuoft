what 18 chanted thereat, both Gospel and Alleluia as far as oblata, it is
a commemoration of the law of the Prophets wherein Christ was
manifaetly foretold, save that it was not seen until He was born.

25 ἶ 7. The elevation of the Chalice, after the full uncovering thereos.
quando canitur oblata, that is a commemoration of Christ’s birth and of
His glory through signs and miracles.

8. Quando cam'tur: Accepit Iesus panem, the priest bows himself down
thrice to repent of his sins. He offers it (the chalice) to God, [and

30 chants Miserere mei De eus ‚] and the people kneels‚ and here no voice f 652
cometh lest it disturb the priest, for this is the right of it, that his
mind separate not from God while he chants this lesson. Hence its
nomen is periculosa oratio.

9. The three steps which the ordained man steppeth backwards and

35 which he again steps forward, this is the triad in which everyone sins, to
wit, in word, in thought, in deed 3 and this is the triad of things by which
he is renova-ted iterum and by which he is moved to Christ's Body.

10. The examination wherewith the priest examines the Chalice and
the Host, and the effort which he essays to break it, that is a figure

40 of the insults and of the buffets and of the seizure (of Christ).

11. The Host οιι the paten (is) Christ' s Flesh on the tree of the Cross.

12. The fraction on the paten is the breaking of Christ's Body
with nails on the Cross.

13. The meeting wherewith the two halves meet after the fraction

45 (is) a figure of the wholeness of Christ’s Body after His resurrection.
