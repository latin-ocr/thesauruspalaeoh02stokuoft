conferred on her, she went to Oruachan Bri Ele in Offaly, since she had 15
heard that bishop Mel was there, together with seven nunS. And when
they arrived, the bishop was not there to meet them, but 116 had gone
northward into the district of Hiii N 6111. So on the morrow she went.
with Mac Oaille to guide her, northward over the Bog of Faichnech.
And God so wrought that the bog became a smooth flowering mead. 20
Now when they drew nigh to the stead wherein was bishop Mel, Brigit
bade Mac Oaille place a veil over her head, so that she might not go 1ο
the clerics without a veil over her head. And that 'would be the veil
which is commemorated. After she had arrived in the house wherein
was bishop Mel, a fiery column flamed out of her head up to the ridge- 25
pole of the church. And bishop Mel beheld that, and asked: ‘Who are
the nuns‘l’ said 116. Mac Caille said to him: ‘That,' said he, ‘is the
famous nun from· Leinster‚ even Erigit) ‘My welcome to her,' said
bishop Mel. ‘It is I who foretold her, when she was in her mother's
womb‚’ said he. (Once on a time when bishop Mel had gone to the house 30
of Dubthach, he saw (his) wife in grief. He asked: ‘what ails the good
woman.’ ‘I have reason,' said she, ‘for the handmaid who is washing your
feet is preferred to me by Dubthach! ‘That is fitting for thee‚' said
bishop Mel, ‘for thy seed shall serve that of the handmaiden.') ‘Where-

fore have the nuns come hither‘l’ said bishop Mel. ‘To have the order 35 .

of penitence conferred,' said Mac Oaille. ‘I will confer it,' said bishop
Mel. 80 thereafter the orders were read out over her, and it came to
pass that bishop Mel conferred on Brigit the episcopal order, though
it was only the order of penitence that she herself desired. And it was

then that Mac Caille held a veil over Brigit' s head, utfhru‘nt periti. And 40 ⁷

hence Brigit’s successor is always entitled to have episcopal orders and
the honour due to a bishop. While the order was being read over her, -
thus she was, with the foot of the altar in her hand. And seven churches
were burnt over that foot, and it was not burnt thet-est. Others say that
the church in which Brigit was ordained was in Fir Telech. Or it isin 45
Ardagh of bishop Mel, ut alii dicunt. So after that bishop Mel preaohed
the eight beatitudes of the Gospel to the eight nuns, after they had all
been ordained‚ and each of them chose her beatitude. Now Brigit chose
the beatitude of mercy. On that occasion she said that she would never
partake of food without being previously preached to, and N atfraich was 50
lector to her always from that time forward, and 116 was of the Fir
