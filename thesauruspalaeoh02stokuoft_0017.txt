With this date the language of the glosses would harmonize: note in
particular the treatment of final vowels in aicneta 181) 12, tricha 31⁰ 9,
aesca 33¹³ 1, fotka 331) 4, oldata 331) 8. Attention may be directed further to
aine=6ine 31⁰ 4, and to dunnai 18b 10, saidai 180 3, to the single consonant
in ‘mais 18¹¹ 1, deis 190 λῆψιν-6111111118 36· 2, rucad 40² 2, oca turcbail 180 2, ina
riaylaib 331) 13, and to leis-sem 32¹· 5, 321) 6, linyidsem 310 8, and to fail 180 4.

That the Irish glosses have been copied, in part at least, from an older
manuscript is evident from their coincidence in part with the glosses, in the
Vienna Beda.

(b) codem Bedae Vindobonensi31.

In the Royal Library of Vienna there is a fragment, whlch probably dates
from the ninth century, consisting of four leaves of Beda's De Temporum
Ratione, in double columns. It is numbered 11. 15928, or suppl. 2698, and
at the bottom of col. 1, p. 1 it bears a stamp ‘E cod. RV. 2269 [Rec. 429]
The leaves have suffered much injury3 in some places the margins have
'been torn away, parts are very hard to decipher‚ parts are altogether illegible.
*Between the lines and on the margins are notes and glosses, Irish and Latin,
in various hands.

3. Comcns CANONUM HIBERNICORUM'2.

(a) Corpus Christi Colleye Cambridya Parker‚ 279.

This manuscript is written in a continental hand, and has been assigned
to the ninth or tenth century3. Among other texts⁴ it contains canons
excerpted from the books of Exodus, Leviticus‚ Numbers, Deuteronomy. In
these excerpts are found Irish glosses, transcribed from the Irish original by
the same hand as the Latin text. The last entry, prescribing the penalty
for shedding a bishop's blood, corresponds with the Ancient Laws of Ireland

IV. 363, ll. 26—27⁶. The gloss on colirio (leg. collyrio), anre, is British, and is
the equivalent of the Irish innrach ‘a tent or plug used to keep wounds open.'

(b) Codex Sanyemnanensis 121 (now MS. Lat. Paris. 12021)⁶.

This manuscript is preserved in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. It
has been assigned by some to the eighth century, by others more correctly
