[siber IIymnomm. xxxix

On the other hand this hymn, which is ascribed to Broccan Cloen, a
diseiple of Ultan of Ard Breccain‚ contains many interesting Old-Irish forms
e.g. qdde l. 49, olith (for did, the perf. sg. 3 of ddnim) l. 76, both l. 70, comcna
l. 100, se‘nta l. 38, ydita l. 66. And in a large proportion of the verses there
are no deviations from the Old-Irish standard except such as may fairly be
put to the account of the scribes.

The connexion of the verses is of the loosest character. Miracle upon
miracle is recorded with a brevity which is often obscure, and no connexion
is apparent between one miracle and the other. In such a disconnected
poem interpolation is easy. To later versifiers it would have been at once a

Ὗ pious and a simple task to add a few more marvels to the greater glory
of S. Brigit. And this would be the easiest explanation of the mixture of
·“ 0Ιά ωιάᾚθνν discernible in the hymn.

In the miracles narrated and in the order of their narration there is a

close agreement between the hymn and the Vita Briqidae by Cogitosus³‚
ζ which forms the best commentary on the hymn. In all probability the
narrative of Cogitosus is based upon the hymn.

VI. Sanctdn’s Hymw.

In this hymn may be noted the rhyme finda : thema ll. 17, 18, the
relative d in no-d-yztasim l. 3, and possibly fltir for ‘rofitir l. 7. The date
of composition is probably the ninth century. The hymn is in two parts, of
which the first, ascribed to Sanctam, ends at line 20, and the second is
addressed to that saint, to the Virgin Mary, and to Christ. Sanctain is

Ι said to have been a Briton, brother of the pilgrim Matoc, and grandson of
Muredach Muinderg, king of Ulaid, who died ΑΛ). 479.

¹ In l. 73 ar-do-utacht is for ar-da-utacht, but this may be an error of transcription.

² Argairt for aryart 1. 33 may be an error of transcription.

⁸ Beprinted by Windisch, Ir. Texte 1. The close agreement may easily be perceived from the
concordanoe given by Bernard and Atkinson‚ 11. 1 sq.
