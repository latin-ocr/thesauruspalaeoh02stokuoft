xxxiv Description of the MSS.

 

Rawl. B. 512, f. 1411), and Laud 610, and is printed in Goidelica, p. 180. In
the Ballymote copy the poem is said to be taken from the Book of
Glendalough, now lost.

V. A poem in praise of some Leinster princeling called Aeol1. If this ·
Aed could be identified, the approximate date of the poem would be
established, for it is evidently the work of some contemporary bard who
sought to please his patron. In its present form the poem shews the
language of the original, but none of the ninth century peculiarities are
established by the rhyme², so that the poem may be safely ascribed to an
earlier date³.

³ Perhaps the form aue may help 1ο fix an inferior limit. In the Annals of Ulster the forms*
aue, auib, auu cease about 760 Aa). When we take into account the fondness of these Annals
for archaistic forms. e.g. Ulotlzz Ulad 809, 894, 897; Mumen 778, 792, Irmumen 8343 Demait

were disappearing from literary use about the middle of the eighth century.
