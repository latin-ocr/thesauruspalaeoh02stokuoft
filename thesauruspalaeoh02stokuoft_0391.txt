brooch which the king of Leinster bestowed on his poet as the reward of
²5 his art. He took it home to his house with him and gave it into the hand
. of the bondmaid to take care of. The poet's wife took it from her (and
cast⁷ it) into the sea for evil to the bondmaid ............ The poet asked the
brooch of the bondmaid ....... The poet came to kin the bondmaid because
the brooch was not found with her. Then Brigit came to the poet's house,
30 and she was grieved at the maltreatment of the bondmaid. So she prayed
to God that the brooch might be manifested to her. Then an angel of God
came to her and told her to cast the nets into the water, that is into the sea,
and a salmon would be caught in them with the brooch in its inside' F¹¹¹⁸

‘once Brigit chanced to come to the fort of the king of Breg in Mag Ooil
in Fingal¹ to-day, and the Queen refused her (entertainment). A certain
widow who dwelt beside the fort outside gave her a welcome and killed
⁴5 (her calf) for her and but-ned her new weaver’s beam under it. And
on the morrow through the grace of Brigit they were whole, both calf and
beam. When, however, the king had heard that, to wit that Brigit
had come, (he went) to converse with her, and that widow chanced to
meet him. When the king saw her, he fell in love with her through the
