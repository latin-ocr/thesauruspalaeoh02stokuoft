Patrick made this hymn. It was made in the time of Loegaire son of
N iall. The cause of its composition, however, was to protect him and
his monks against deadly enemies that lay in wait for the clerics. And
this is 3 corslet of faith for the protection of body and soul against devils
and men and vices. When anyone shall repeat it every day with 15
diligent intentness on God, devils shall not dare to face him, it shall be a
- protection to him against every poison and envy‚ it shall be a defenoe to
him against sudden death, it shall be a eorslet to his soul after his death. =
Patriok sang this when the ambuscades were laid against his eoming by
Loegaire, that 113 might not go to Tara to sow the faith. And then it ω
appeared before those lying 111 ambush that they (Patriek and his monks)
were wild deer with a fawn (Benen) following thema. And its 1131113 13
