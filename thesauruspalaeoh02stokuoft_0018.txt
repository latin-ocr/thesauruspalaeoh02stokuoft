to a somewhat later date¹. It contains in ff. 33—127 a collection of Irish
canons, with a few Irish glosses. Both text and glosses have been copied
from an older codex,

4. 00111033 LIBRI DE COMPU'ro.

(a) O'odeoe Vaticanus n. 57552.

This codex consists for the most part of a copy of St Augustine’s work
De Trinitate: to this, however, fo. 2, 3 and fo. 63—73 do not belong, but
contain fragments of a computus. Fo. 2, which begins with nihil remanserit
and ends with si quando mense ‘martio XIIII · luna pascalis incurrit XXXIII·
reyulares in poimis teneas: ex quibus aepactas cuius uollaem's anni deducas,
contains the Paschal Arguments of Dionysius VIII, IX, X, and XIV. On the
margins of this folio there are copious notes in Latin, with the exception of
one which is partly in Irish3 between the lines are found notes and glosses in
Irish and Latin. The codex has been assigned to the eleventh century⁸3 on
fo. 2, however, the Irish seems to represent the language of the eighth century,
and there is no clear evidence that the Irish glosses have been copied.

(b) Oodea: N anciacensisffi

This is a fragment consisting of a single leaf, written in an Irish hand
of the ninth century, attached to the inner cover of Ood. 59 of the Library
of Nancy. It contains copious Latin notes and glosses on the margins and
between the lines, and also a number of Irish glosses. The Latin text
contains the Dionysiae Paschal Arguments XI, XIII.

5. 00111033 ΕυΤῩοΗΗ.

(α) Codeoe Vindobonensis n. 16⁶.

This manuscript, which formerly belonged to the Columban monastery of
Bobbio, is now in the Royal Library of Vienna. Ff. 57—68 contain a text
of Eutychii de discernendis coniugationibus Libri II. written in a hand of
the eighth or ninth century, with Irish 8103363. That these glosses have
been copied is shewn by the fact that ylaidim has become attached to rudo
instead of to erado.
