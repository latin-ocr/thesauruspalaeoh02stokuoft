Codex Bibl. Rey. Monacensis, God. Lat. 14846. xxv

12. Comi-x BERNENsrs 363¹.

This codex is preserved in the Stadtbibliothek of Berne, and contains
Servii Mauri grammatici Commentarius in Bucolica Georgica et Aeneidem
Virgilii, fo. 1—142, Horace, fo. 167 a—186d (odae, epodi, carmen saeculare,
ars poetica, et sermonum lib. 1 usque ad sat. 111., v. 134), part of Ovid’s
Metamorphoses Bedae Historia Britanniae, and a variety of other works.
According to Traube the codex (which is wholly in an Irish hand) is not
earlier than the end of the ninth century'. It is a copy of one or more older
Irish manuscripts, and it is not impossible that all the marginalia have been
transcribed from the original'. These marginalia carry us into the circle of
Sedulius⁴ and the middle of the ninth century. The original belonged to
North Italy, probably to Milan⁶.

13. Connx BIBL. Bm. MONAcnnsrs‚ Con. LAT. 14846⁸.

- This is a manuscript in the Hof- und Staatsbibliothek of Munich, assigned

to the tenth⁷ or eleventh century⁸. It has on the back the title: In
Donatum de Grammatica, Saec. IX„ and consists for the most part of
Emhanberti commentarius in Donatum minorem. Ff. 106—121‚ however,
contain a collection of Latin sortes; on fo, 106¹, which is otherwise blank,
another hand has written: Sortileyia per literas et sacros libros quorum
ν’ ‘meminit diuus yreyorius turonensis. These sortes are of various kinds. In
those printed below (pp. 236, 237) the prefixed letters have reference to the
consultation of the Psalter3 unless it was otherwise prescribed, the initial
letter of the word which first met the eye would seem to have been decisive.

The operation is denoted by the phrase librum tenere.
The Latin text is corrupt, and it has had incorporated with it both
Irish and British glosses, much distorted in the process of transcription.
