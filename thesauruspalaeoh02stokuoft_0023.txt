Codices Philaryym‘i. xvii

 

Ῐιᾱαεαῐ. That they are earlier than the bulk of the glosses in Wb. seems
to be indicated by the fact that the gen. sg. of -i- and -u- stems is always
in ·o : folo, 9le‘so, senso, spirto. After a non-palatal consonant i is regularly
expressed by i: yabis, fodil, samil, delbich, 9midich, ceolis, delire, ἀᾶίάτζ, etc.¹
After a non-palatal consonant final -e is expressed by e: derbensde, tarsende,
or by ωε rame, seciam, etc.² The diphthong oe does not yet appear.

9. GomcEs PHILARGYR113.

Two series of excerpts from Iunius Philargyrius' scholia on the Bucolics
are preserved in three manuscripts:

P. (=N. Hagen)=Codex Parisiacus Lat. 7960, saec. X. In this MS. the second series
of excerpts is found fo. 12—-142, the first series of excerpts on fo. l4b—-41b.

L.=Codex Laurentian Plut. XLV. Ood. 14, 3. x. According to Hagen the manuscript
was brought from France. The colophon to the first series (Rheinisches Museum. N. F.
xv. 119) seems to contain a Latin rendering—Fatosus—of the name of the Irish excerptor,
which may have been Toietlzeek: 366 The Academy for J uly 28, 1894, Rev. Oelt. xvt. 123.

P2. (=P. Hagen)=Codex Parisinus 11308, s. lx.

With regard to the relations of the three manuscripts the following may be
noted. P and L are very closely related and come-from a common source, but
P was not copied from L norL from P. P² is fuller and more correct than P
and L, but is not the source from which they have been copied. Errors common
to the three MSS. indicate that they go back to a common source, into which
many mistakes had already crept through the transcriber's ignorance of the
Irish language and his unfamiliarity with the script. The three codices are
all in a continental hand. It is not improbable that the archetype from
which all the three MSS. finally came was written by a continental scribe.

The Irish of the glosses is of the same archaic character as that of the

Book of Armagh. Its peculiarities have been discussed by Thurneysen, Oelt.
zeitschr. 111. 52 sq.⁴

¹ Hence we should write in 171·2 ruminiqed, in 176b frisintomaltid, in 182⁸2 siltid.

² Hence in 170b1 adamra should be corrected to adamre. In 177·2, as Mr Edward Gwynn
informs us, the last half 'of the last letter of etalacda has been lost by the cutting of the margin;
mlacdoe should be restored.

⁸ A few of the glosses were published by Thilo, Rhein. Mus„ Neue Folge, xur. 132, and were
reprinted by Zimmer, Gloss. Hib. Supplementum 5, with the addition of two from the same
codices contributed by Hagen. The glosses in P were printed by W. S. in the Academy for
Jan. 17, 1891, and again in the Rev. Gelt. xrv. 226 sq. The glosses from L were published
by W. 8., ΚΖ. xxxnx. 62 sq. The glosses from Ρ2 did not come to our knowledge till after the
sheet of the Thesaurus containing the other glosses had been printed off. They are published in
Appendix 1. from a transcript kindly made for us by the late Μ. L. Dnvau. Both the Latin
text and the Irish 3103363 have now been edited by Hagen, Serv. Gram. vol. 111. Fasc. 11. Appendix
Servim3 to this edition we are indebted for some additions and corrections. Cf. also Servius
ed. Thilo m. 1. v.
