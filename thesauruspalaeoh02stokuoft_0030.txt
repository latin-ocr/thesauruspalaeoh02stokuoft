xxiv Description of tlte MSS.

B. Oodeae Auyiensis CXXXII, mmo Oarolsruhanusk

This manuscript formerly belonged to the monastery of Reichenau : it is
now in the Hof- und Landesbibliothek in Carlsruhe. It consists of 10⁷
leaves written in an Irish hand of the ninth century2. On the margin and
between the lines Latin and Irish notes have been added by different hands.

Ο. Codex Leidensis Lat. 67⁸.

This manuscript is preserved in the University Library of Leyden. It
consists of 219 leaves, and was written about the middle of the ninth
century⁴. F o. 9²² sqq. contain the text of Priscian's Latin grammar, with some
lacunae, written by more than one hand. On the margin and between the
lines are a considerable number of Latin glosses and notes and a few Irish
glosses in different hands, printed infra p. 231.

D. Fraymentum Ambrosianum ⁶.

Ood. A 138 of the Ambrosian Library, Milan, contains Haymonis Oomm. in
Epistulas S. Pauli ad Hebraeos, ad Corinth. 1 et 2. This is preceded by three
leaves, of which the first two contain a fragment of the vulgate text of the
prophet Ezechiel, the last a fragment of Priscian, Bk. iv auribus excipitur
man (Hertz Ι. 139, 9)-Bk. v consonantis quidem antecedente (Hertz Ι. 150, 14).
Haymonis Comm. has come undoubtedly from Bobbio. Consequently it may
be inferred that the Priscian came from the same place. On the verso of
the second leaf an Irish hand has added the contents of Haymon’s Com-
mentary‚ which shews that the two leaves were attached to the commentary
from a very ancient datess. The nine Irish glosses contained in this fragment
are printed infra p. 232.

11. CODEX AMBRosrANus‚ F. 60 sup.⁷

The manuscript bears the title “ Sententiae sanctorum Doctorum et
Patrum.'' The five Irish glosses printed infra p. 234 are on fo. 60.
