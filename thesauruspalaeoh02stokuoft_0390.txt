‘three strong men were digging the ditch of Dun Alinne, one of the ²0
three chief forts of the King of Leinster. Their names are Mureth and
Fiac and Lugaid. Each of them used to eat the dinner of a hundred.
Now Lugaid had been entrusted to the church to feed, and the two others
to the laity. So Lugaid asked Brigit to diminish his appetite without
taking away his strength. Brigit did that for him, and she blessed his ²5
mouth so that his appetite was not greater than that of any other man.
Then he went and raised a stone, which a hundred of them had been
unable to do the day before, out of the ditch on to the top of Alenn
